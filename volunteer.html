    <h2 id="runs"> NOAH'S ARK RUNS ON VOLUNTEERS</h2><br>
      <br />
  <section id="paraone">
      <p> We are always looking for dedicated volunteers that can commit to a set number of hours per month. There is a lot of "behind the scenes" work to be done to keep our sanctuary running smoothly. This could range from cleaning cages to unfolging newspaper to bottle feeding infant animals. Our volunteers are appreciated by the staff, adopters, and especially the animals here.<br>
      <br />
      There is a lot of work to be done here everyday. Please be prepare to some physical work. You must be at least 16 to volunteer alone. Children 9 and older who want to volunteer can be accompanied by their volunteer parents, but must be supervised by them at all times. <br>
      <br />
      Not everyone can do the hard work, we understand. There are a lot of other opportunities as well. Please consider on of our new programs if you're unable to volunteer for a full 3 hour shift at the sanctuary.<br>
      <br />

    <h2 id="foster"> FOSTER</h2><br>
      <br />
      <p id="paratwo"> Fostering for Noah's Ark allows us to save more animals. Fostering entails housing and socializing a cat or kitten until they are ready for adoption. If you have an office or business that can house an adult cat, you can foster! If you have a spare room in your home for a mom and her kittens, you can foster! If you have the time and dedication to save orphaned kittens and bottle feed them, you can foster! Please come in to the Ark for more information on fostering. </p>

          We want more dog walkers! Come in and work 4 - 3hr volunteer shifts and take the required dog walking class. Then you can sign the dog walking waiver and come in whenever the kennels are open. We hope it will be often! You have to be at least 16 to do this job, under 16 years of age can walk dogs with a parent present.

          <p id="parafour">
            We need volunteers to help us do more fundraising. You would be walking around selling raffle tickerts or collecting donations, showing off animals, standing behind a table answering questions, and helping us to set up and tear down our booth. If you have an outgoing personality, this one is for you! Purchasing a Noah's Ark T-shirt is a requirement.

            <p id="parafive">
            We're looking for people with loads of charm to answer phones, complete office projects as needed, welcome people when they come in, and start their visit off pleasantly. You need to be able to tolerate a wide variety of attitudes (with a big smile on your face) to do this job.
