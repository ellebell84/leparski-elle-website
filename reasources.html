  <h2>Surrender Info</h2>

  <section id="one">
    <p>We understand that sometimes it's just not possible to keep a pet, but before making that decision please consider all your options.</p>
    <br>
    <p>When a pet is surrendered to a shelter the transition is
      difficult for them. Shelters are a high stress environment
      even for the most well-adjusted animal.</p>
    <br>
    <p style="color:#33CCFF;">Before you make your final Decision Please do the following:</p>
    <br>
      <ul>
        <li> Consult a trainer or behaviorist for help with behavior
        problems.</li>
        <li>Talk to your veterinarian to rule out possible medical
        issues your pet may be experiencing.</li>
        <li>Look for an alternative place to live that accepts pets.</li>
        <li>Don't drop your pet off in the woods or countryside.</li>
        <li>Don't abandon your animal in a house or apartment
        thinking they will find a new home.</li>
        <li>Don't give your pet to a stranger.</li>
      </ul>
<br>
    <p style="color:#33CCFF;"> If you have exhausted all other avenues, consider surrendering your animal to Noah's Ark. <br /> Necessary documents to surrender: </p>
<br>
    <ul>
      <li> Valid photo I.D.</li>
      <li>Any pertinent records on the animal; medical records,
      registration papers, bill of sale, etc.</li>
      <li>Owners signature must be provided for Noah's Ark to
      accept an animal.</li>
    </ul>
<br>
    <p> We do require a surrender fee of $5 to help offset the
      costs for caring for your pet. </p>
<br>
    <p>We do not take aggressive  animals. We are a limited intake facility so please call  ahead and check availability and make appointment for surrender. </p>

      <div class="anhosp1">
        <p> Our animal hospital is just down the road from our Sanctuary! Noah's Ark Animal Hospital is a low cost spay/neuter clinic with reasonable prices. We also offer vaccines, exams, heartworm testing, microchipping, FELV/FIV testing, and fecal exams. <br>
          <br />
          Overpopulation is one of the main causes of death od domesticated cats and dogs. We encourge all people to do their part and have their animals altered in an effort to better their health and reduce the stray population.
